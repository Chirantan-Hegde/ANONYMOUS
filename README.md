👩‍⚕️ What Can V-DOC Do?
🗣️ 1. Talk to You About Your Symptoms
Feeling unwell but don’t want to rush to the doctor just yet? Just tell V-DOC what’s bothering you. It’ll listen (via chat or voice), ask a few smart follow-up questions, and suggest what might be going on — whether it's a common cold or something more serious that needs real attention.

📊 2. Keep an Eye on Your Health
V-DOC can connect to your smartwatch or fitness band and quietly keep tabs on your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and even how well you slept. If something seems off, it lets you know — and can even alert someone you trust.

💊 3. Help You Stay on Track With Medications
No more forgotten pills! V-DOC reminds you when to take your meds, tracks how you're feeling after, and even warns you if two medications might not go well together.

🗂️ 4. Carry Your Medical Records, Safely
Lost prescriptions? Lab results scattered? V-DOC stores all your medical history neatly and securely. It's like your digital health diary — accessible anytime, and easy to share with a real doctor when needed.

📞 5. Connect You to Real Doctors
Need a second opinion or can’t get to a clinic? V-DOC can connect you with certified doctors for a video or audio consultation. And since it’s already been keeping track of your symptoms and vitals, your doctor’s job becomes easier and faster.

🚨 6. Be There in Emergencies
If you ever faint or face a health crisis, V-DOC can act instantly — alerting emergency contacts, sharing your location, and providing medical info to responders.
